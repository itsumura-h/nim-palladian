# useState
useState is a hook provided by React and Preact that allows you to add state to functional components.  
State refers to the data that is held by a component and can change over time, often in response to user interactions or other events.

The useState hook takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two items: the current state value and a function that can be used to update that value.
